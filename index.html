    <p>The 1991 hit song "Walking Memphis" orignally by singer songwritter Marc Cohn's poetically recalls his first visit to Memphis-the taproot for some of his treasured, influential musicians like Al Green, Elvis Presley, and Issac Hayes.</p>
    <div>
    <p>The song embodies a alot of the spirit and character of the city. If you're passing through or spending leisure time in town, lines from the song point out great things about Memphis and some potential sighseeing spots.</p>
    <div>
        <head><h2>The Inspiration for the Song</h2></head>
        <p>The story goes that Cohn's was having a dry spell coming up with his signature music and lyrics. He was inspired by masterful singer and songwritter James Taylor who had said that he broke his writer's block by going somewhere he'd never been before and then got inspiration from that experience. Memphis was just the place for Cohn's.</p>
        <p>As you learn from that song, Cohn did touristy things like visited Graceland but also asked friends for more obsure, off-the-beaten-path suggestions, which resulted in a visit to the Full Gospel Tabernacle church and the Hollywood Cafe'in Robinsonville, Mississippi.</p>

    <head><h2>References to Elivs and Sightseeing Spots</h2></head>
    <p>Cohn amkes quite a few references in the lyrics about Elivs. Cohn says he regrets this in highsight because the song was not meant as an homage to Elvis.
